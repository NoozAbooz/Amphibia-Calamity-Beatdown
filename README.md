# Amphibia: Calamity Beatdown

ACD is a WIP fangame for the Disney cartoon Amphibia, built on Godot Engine. The game levels are built in 3D, while all characters and enemies are made with 2D pixel art. The game is styled like a classic beat-em-up game, with a focus on fast movement and percise attacks.
